# Call for Papers

We welcome submissions on the following topics:

* Foundations of concept representations and learning in XAI, CRL and NeSy.
* Supervised and unsupervised techniques for learning concepts from
  observational and interventional data, raw inputs, and pre-trained
  embeddings.
* Techniques for learning concepts in non-standard settings, e.g., causal
  abstraction.
* Design and evaluation of concept-based XAI techniques and self-explainable
  concept-based models.
* Interactive human-machine concept acquisition and alignment.
* Applications of concept-based AI systems, including but not limited to,
  reasoning, causality, formal verification, interactive learning, and
  explainability.
* Metrics and evaluation techniques for assessing the quality of learned
  concepts, with a focus on down-stream applications.

Submissions should present novel, unpublished work. Work that previously
appeared in non-archival venues (such as arXiv or other workshops without
proceedings) is allowed.

The UCRL workshop is non-archival, and should thus generally not violate dual
submission policies at other archival venues (e.g., submitting work that is
currently under review at another conference such as NeurIPS is permitted); if
unsure, please check yourself with the corresponding venue.


## Format

Submissions should be **double-blind** and formatted using the [ICLR latex template and formatting
instructions](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2026.zip).

Papers should be **up to 6 pages** in length, including all main results, figures, and tables. 
Appendices containing additional details are allowed, but reviewers are not expected to take this into account.

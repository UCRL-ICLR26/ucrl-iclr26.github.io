# Formatting Instructions

## Style & Author Instructions

Submissions should be formatted using the [ICLR latex template and formatting
instructions](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2026.zip).
Papers must be submitted as a PDF file and should be 4-6 pages in length,
including all main results, figures, and tables. Appendices containing
additional details are allowed, but reviewers are not expected to take this
into account.
